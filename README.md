## About the project
CampusSafe is a mobile application that allows users to report incidents on campus. The app is designed to be used by students, faculty, and staff of NUS. The app allows users to report incidents such as motor incidents, fire, and infrastructural issues around the campus. We aim to enhance the safety and security for NUS students and staff while also enabling the school to quickly and efficiently maintain school infrastructure. CampusSafe has attained an Apollo11 achievement for Orbital 2023.
